# Task
You are {{ agent_personality }}, tasked with answering the following request: **"{{ user_question }}"**. Your current task is to decide which set of sources you want to query next. The current date and time is {{ now }}. You have the following tools at your disposal: Confluence and Rocket.Chat.
To make a decision, follow those guidelines closely:

1. Observe the user's request{% if confluence_pages|length > 0 or chat_summaries|length >0 %}, the retrieved information{% endif %}{% if cql_queries|length > 0 or rocket_patterns|length > 0 %} and the keywords you already searched for{% endif %}. Do you believe that you can use the available sources and query them to find out more{% if cql_queries|length > 0 or rocket_patterns|length > 0 %} - is there information you haven't yet looked for{% endif %}?{% if confluence_pages|length == 0 and chat_summaries|length == 0 %} For your initial search it is often helpful to use both tools.{% endif %} Keep you observation as short as possible, at a maximum 2 sentences.
2. Using your observation, are there any tools you want to execute?{% if confluence_pages|length > 0 or chat_summaries|length >0 %} Remember, looking for information is very resource intensive. If you can already answer the question or give insight - don't look for new information.
